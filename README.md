# cs448b-assign4
final project of cs448b

GTD preexisting visualizations (pros and cons)

Globe
- no color legend (hard to see what each color represents)
- perspective warped on length of spikes
- hard to compare with different years
- design-wsie reloading is awkward

Static Concentration Map
- static
- hard to get more relevant information
- color scheme is intuitive

Highlighting
- timer automatic animation + time slider is good idea
- additional context information is very helpful
- color scheme is relatively unintuitive
- points overlap each other giving the illusion that terrorism happens all the time in bigger scales

World of Terror
- snippets of certain terrorist groups nice
- sorting function helpful
- interactivity good
- very high level data : whether incidents happened and how many were killed (no necessary context for why it happened or how it evolved, what methods they mainly use)
	: we want to focus more on data funneling (more layers!)
